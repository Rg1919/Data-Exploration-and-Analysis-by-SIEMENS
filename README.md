# Data-Exploration-and-Analysis-by-SIEMENS

## Project Overview

This project combines two Python scripts for data exploration and visualization: the "Multiple Y-Axis Plotter" and the "Multi-Y-Axis Time Series Data Plotter." These scripts are designed to simplify the process of visualizing and analyzing CSV datasets, particularly those containing multiple variables and time series data. The project provides an interactive and customizable toolset for data analysts and scientists.

### Features

#### Multiple Y-Axis Plotter

- **Interactive Column Selection:** Easily select X and Y-axis columns using search strings.
- **Customizable Colors:** Customize colors for each plotted dataset.
- **Dynamic Legends:** Legends for each Y-axis are automatically generated.
- **Adjustable X-Axis:** Define the X-axis range to focus on specific data points or time periods.

#### Multi-Y-Axis Time Series Data Plotter

- **Interactive Column Selection:** Quickly choose X and Y-axis columns with search strings.
- **Customizable Colors:** Customize colors to enhance visualization.
- **Dynamic Legends:** Legends for each Y-axis are generated for dataset identification.
- **Adjustable X-Axis:** Set the X-axis time range to explore specific time periods.
- **Efficient Data Filtering:** Filter data based on the selected X-axis range.

### How to Use

#### Multiple Y-Axis Plotter

1. **X-Axis Selection:** Enter a search string to choose the X-axis column from your CSV dataset.
2. **Y-Axis Selection:** Specify the number of Y-axes to plot and provide search strings for Y-axis columns.
3. **Customization:** Customize colors and set the X-axis range.
4. **Interactive Plot:** Explore an interactive plot with multiple Y-axes.

#### Multi-Y-Axis Time Series Data Plotter

1. **X-Axis Selection:** Enter a search string to select the X-axis (time) column from your CSV dataset.
2. **Y-Axis Selection:** Specify the number of Y-axes to plot and provide search strings for Y-axis columns.
3. **Customization:** Customize colors and set the X-axis time range.
4. **Interactive Plot:** Explore an interactive plot with multiple Y-axes.

### Benefits

- **Data Exploration:** Simplifies the exploration of complex datasets with multiple variables.
- **Visualization:** Provides an effective tool for comparing and contrasting multiple datasets on a single graph.
- **Interactivity:** Offers interactive column selection and customization options for various data analysis tasks.
- **Clarity:** Different colors and legends ensure easy differentiation between datasets, improving plot clarity.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines the process of creating multiple Y-axis plots, saving time and effort in data visualization tasks.

## Conclusion

The "Data Exploration and Visualization" project is a valuable resource for data analysts and scientists working with CSV datasets. It simplifies data exploration and visualization, enhances data clarity, and offers interactivity for various data analysis tasks. Whether you're exploring multiple variables or analyzing time series data, these tools contribute to informed decision-making and insights extraction from complex datasets.
